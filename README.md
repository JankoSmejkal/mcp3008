# mcp3008
Basic RaspberryPi &amp; Python project with mcp3008 ADC, potentiometer and 6 LEDs

# Goal
To control 6 LEDs with Raspberry Pi using potentiometer and mcp3008 ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)

# Description
This project uses mcp3008 ADC to get the Voltage output from potentiometer. LEDs are activated with simple "if" statements accordingly to the output value

# Equipment
- Raspberry Pi 3 model B
- mcp3008 ADC
- LED x 6
- Potentiometer
- 330 ohm resistor x 6
